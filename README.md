# Neural-Net-based-Autonomous-System-for-Self-Driven-Car

## Objective

To train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for enabling a self-driving car. 

## Project Description

Transfer learning is a way to utilize previously trained neural nets. We will use ResNet 50 since it is a high quality Neural Net for object recognition that has been pre-trained on a very large dataset.

The ResNet 50 layer is followed by 3 fully connected layers having 512, 256 and 64 neurons respectively.

We are using Adam optimizer to minimize loss and the learning rate is set at 0.001.
